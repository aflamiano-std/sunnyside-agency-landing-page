This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).
By undertaking this challenge, I am able to improve my coding skills by experiencing how to build a realistic project.

## Overview

This is the first project I made where I put my knowledge in HTML and CSS to the test as a practicing front-end web developer. 

### The challenge

The challenge for this project is to build out the landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

It focuses mostly on HTML & CSS and there is also a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.

Users who view this page should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

1. By doing a mobile first approach while also taking the desktop design into consideration, I created the HTML markup starting with the general containers, the headers and the flex parents I intend to manipulate later.
2. I then proceeded styling with CSS and with the separation of sections from my HTML markup, I focused on finishing one section first before moving onto the next. I decided to skip the navigation part here because it has a completely different design when viewed from a mobile and from a desktop.
3. Once I was done with all the sections, I moved onto styling the navigation. The callout "look" when displaying the navigation menu on mobile view was a bit challenging and took some googling to accomplish. Once the mobile view of the navigation was done, I added the JS to toggle it and from there finishing the navigation for desktop was a breeze.
4. After all of that was done, I added the active states for all the links and completed the project.
