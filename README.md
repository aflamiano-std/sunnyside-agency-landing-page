![Design preview for the Sunnyside agency landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).
By undertaking this challenge, I am able to improve my coding skills by experiencing how to build a realistic project.

## Overview

This is the first project I made where I put my knowledge in HTML and CSS to the test as a practicing front-end web developer. 

### The challenge

The challenge for this project is to build out the landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

It focuses mostly on HTML & CSS and there is also a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.

Users who view this page should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [View Page](https://aflamiano-std.github.io/sunnyside-agency-landing-page/)

## My process

1. By doing a mobile first approach while also taking the desktop design into consideration, I created the HTML markup starting with the general containers, the headers and the flex parents I intend to manipulate later.
2. I then proceeded styling with CSS and with the separation of sections from my HTML markup, I focused on finishing one section first before moving onto the next. I decided to skip the navigation part here because it has a completely different design when viewed from a mobile and from a desktop.
3. Once I was done with all the sections, I moved onto styling the navigation. The callout "look" when displaying the navigation menu on mobile view was a bit challenging and took some googling to accomplish. Once the mobile view of the navigation was done, I added the JS to toggle it and from there finishing the navigation for desktop was a breeze.
4. After all of that was done, I added the active states for all the links and completed the project.


### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### Continued development

For this page, flexbox was more than enough for styling the whole layout. There are still some hiccups here and there while getting accustomed to flexbox's behavior and quirks but I want to get more comfortable in using it. For future projects, I also want to look into using grid and making good use of both of them.

I also plan to continue using the BEM naming convention. Using this convention helped a lot in identifying which parts go together and where they fit in the layout. It also helped simplify troubleshooting when issues arise.
